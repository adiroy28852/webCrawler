# Distributed Web Crawler in Go

This document outlines the steps to build a distributed web crawler using Go. It covers project setup, core functionalities, and best practices for creating a robust and scalable crawler.

## 1. Project Setup

*   **Initialize Go module:** `go mod init crawler`
*   **Create project structure:**
    ```
    crawler/
    ├── main.go
    ├── crawler/
    │   ├── crawler.go
    │   └── worker.go
    ├── storage/
    │   └── storage.go
    ├── queue/
    │   └── queue.go
    ├── utils/
    │   └── utils.go
    └── README.md
    ```

## 2. Core Functionalities

*   **URL Frontier:** Manages the list of URLs to be crawled.
*   **Fetcher:** Downloads web pages from URLs.
*   **Parser:** Extracts relevant information and new links from downloaded pages.
*   **Storage:** Stores fetched data and discovered links.
*   **Scheduler:** Distributes tasks among multiple workers.
*   **Concurrency:** Utilizes goroutines and channels for efficient parallel processing.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Data Structures

*   `CrawlRequest`: Represents a request to crawl a URL.
*   `CrawlResult`: Stores the outcome of a crawl operation.
*   `PageData`: Contains extracted information from a webpage.

### Step 2: Implement Core Components

*   **Fetcher:** Implement HTTP client to download web pages.
*   **Parser:** Use HTML parsing libraries to extract links and data.
*   **Storage:** Choose a storage solution (e.g., in-memory, database) and implement save/load functions.
*   **Queue:** Implement a thread-safe queue for managing URLs to visit.

### Step 3: Implement Concurrency

*   **Worker Pool:** Create a pool of goroutines to process URLs concurrently.
*   **Channel Communication:** Use channels for communication between the scheduler and workers.

### Step 4: Build the Scheduler

*   Manages the URL queue and distributes tasks to worker goroutines.
*   Handles retries and error logging.

### Step 5: Create the Main Application

*   Initializes all components.
*   Starts the crawling process.
*   Provides a way to monitor and control the crawler.

## 4. Advanced Features (Optional)

*   **Robots.txt Respect:** Implement politeness rules by respecting `robots.txt`.
*   **Duplicate Content Detection:** Use hashing or other techniques to avoid processing the same content multiple times.
*   **Distributed Coordination:** If building a truly distributed crawler, consider using tools like ZooKeeper or etcd for coordination.

## 5. Deployment and Execution

*   **Build the application:** `go build`
*   **Run the application:** `./crawler`

This is a high-level overview. Each step involves writing Go code and testing thoroughly.

## 6. GitHub and Resume Presentation

*   **Clear README:** Your `README.md` is crucial. It should include:
    *   Project Title and Description.
    *   Features Implemented.
    *   Technologies Used (Go, specific libraries).
    *   Setup and Installation Instructions (how to clone, build, and run).
    *   Usage Examples.
    *   Project Structure Explanation.
    *   Contribution Guidelines (if open to contributions).
    *   License Information.
*   **Well-structured Code:** Follow Go conventions. Organize your code into logical packages (e.g., `crawler`, `fetcher`, `parser`, `storage`, `queue`, `scheduler`).
*   **Comments:** Add meaningful comments to explain complex parts of your code, especially around concurrency logic.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for key components to demonstrate reliability. Go has built-in support for testing.
*   **Makefile (Optional but good):** A Makefile can simplify build, test, and run commands (e.g., `make build`, `make test`, `make run`).
*   **Git Commits:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   **Demonstrate Go Internals Understanding (in README or code comments):**
    *   Explain how you used goroutines and channels for concurrency and why.
    *   If you explored any specific Go runtime aspects (e.g., scheduler behavior, memory management considerations for a crawler), mention them.
*   **Resume Points:**
    *   Clearly state the project and its purpose.
    *   Highlight the use of Go, concurrency (goroutines, channels), and any distributed aspects.
    *   Quantify achievements if possible (e.g., "Crawled X pages per minute", "Reduced processing time by Y% using concurrent workers").
    *   Mention challenges faced and how you overcame them (good for interview discussions).
    *   Link to your GitHub repository.

By following these steps, you can create an impressive project that showcases your Go skills and understanding of software engineering principles.
