# High-Level Design (HLD) Document: Distributed Web Crawler

## 1. Introduction

*   **Purpose:** Briefly describe the purpose of this document and the web crawler project.
*   **Scope:** Define what the system will and will not do.
*   **Goals:** List the main goals (e.g., scalability, fault tolerance, politeness).
*   **Non-Goals:** List what is explicitly out of scope.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

*   **Architectural Diagram:** A high-level block diagram showing the major components and their interactions. (You can describe this in text if you can't draw a diagram here, or create a simple ASCII art diagram).
*   **Component Descriptions:** For each major component identified, provide a brief description of its responsibilities.
    *   **Example Components:**
        *   **Seed URL Manager/Input:** How do initial URLs get into the system?
        *   **URL Frontier (Queue):** Manages URLs to be crawled, prioritizes, handles duplicates, ensures politeness (e.g., delay between requests to the same domain).
        *   **Fetcher/Downloader Workers:** Responsible for fetching web page content from URLs provided by the Frontier.
        *   **Parser Workers:** Responsible for parsing fetched HTML content to extract new links and relevant data.
        *   **Data Storage:** Stores fetched content, extracted links, and potentially metadata (e.g., crawl timestamps, page checksums).
        *   **Scheduler/Coordinator (Optional, for more advanced distributed setup):** Manages worker nodes, distributes tasks, handles failures.
        *   **Robots.txt Handler:** Fetches and interprets `robots.txt` files to ensure compliance.

## 3. Data Flow

*   Describe how data moves through the system. For example:
    1.  Seed URLs are fed into the URL Frontier.
    2.  Fetcher workers pick URLs from the Frontier.
    3.  Fetchers download page content and pass it to Parser workers.
    4.  Parsers extract new links (which go back to the URL Frontier) and data (which goes to Data Storage).
    5.  (And so on for other interactions).

## 4. Key Design Considerations

*   **Scalability:** How will the system handle an increasing number of URLs and larger websites? (e.g., adding more workers, distributed queue, sharded storage).
*   **Fault Tolerance & Resilience:** What happens if a worker fails? What if a website is unresponsive? How does the system recover?
*   **Concurrency Model:** Briefly describe how concurrency will be managed at a high level (e.g., multiple worker processes/threads, event-driven architecture).
*   **Politeness:** How will the crawler avoid overloading websites? (e.g., respecting `robots.txt`, crawl delays per domain).
*   **Data Storage Strategy:** What kind of data needs to be stored, and what are the high-level requirements for the storage system (e.g., NoSQL, SQL, file system)?
*   **Duplicate URL/Content Handling:** How will the system avoid re-crawling or re-processing the same URLs or content?

## 5. Technology Choices (High-Level)

*   **Programming Language:** Go (as specified).
*   **Key Libraries/Frameworks (Anticipated):** Mention any major Go libraries you might use for HTTP requests, HTML parsing, etc., at a high level.
*   **Potential External Services:** Any databases, message queues, or other services you might integrate with.

## 6. Assumptions and Dependencies

*   List any assumptions made during the HLD (e.g., network connectivity, format of web pages).
*   List any external dependencies.

*(This is a template. You will fill in the details based on your project decisions. We can discuss each section.)*
